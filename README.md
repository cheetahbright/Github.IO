* Zillowâ€™s Home Value Prediction (Zestimate)

My friend [Malcolm Taylor](malcolmtaylor15.github.io) and I worked on this Kaggle project to improve Zillow's 'Zestimate' score. In other words, we analyzed almost one million inputs to develop an algorithm to better predict which houses their Zestimate score would do poorly on. We spent a good portion of the time wrangling the data including feature engineering.

* Wine Quality
