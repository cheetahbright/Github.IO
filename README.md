Hi I'm Devin and I'm currently a technical security specialist. Here you can find short descriptions of some projects I've worked on outside of my job below.

# Projects

## 2018
* Spotify NLP Excursion

My friend [Malcolm Taylor](malcolmtaylor15.github.io) and I are working on this project to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to song lyrics from a users' Spotify playlists or individual songs. We utilize the Genius and Spotify APIs. We've also advanced our Git knowledge dramatically through this collaboration.

## 2017
* Zillowâ€™s Home Value Prediction (Zestimate)

My friend [Malcolm Taylor](malcolmtaylor15.github.io) and I worked on this Kaggle project to improve Zillow's 'Zestimate' score. In other words, we analyzed almost one million inputs to develop an algorithm to better predict which houses their Zestimate score would do poorly on. We spent a good portion of the time wrangling the data including feature engineering.

* Wine Quality
